# dlist class

At the moment, it compiles and builds in visual studio 2017 and g++ 5.3.1-1ubuntu or something.
The dlist class is a doubly linked list. The dnode class is setup for doubly linked list.
I've only tested dlist with primitive data types.
So far it seems fine. Because I didn't implement iterators, I'm most likely going to leave it as is. 
The functions implemented work as intended.
Hoping for pizza in the near future. 
I still feel like I am not using github correctly. I am using this more like a blog of my demise.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
