# binary_search_tree class

At the moment, it compiles and builds in visual studio 2017 and g++ 5.3.1-1ubuntu or something.
All the classes live in the drw namespace, so keep that in mind.

The basics of inserting works and checking if the BST contains a certain item.
I feel like my code is starting to look more like C++11.
