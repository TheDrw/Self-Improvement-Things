# Self-Improvement-Things

In this thing, I'll be recreating some data structures and algorithms for learning purposes. 
If you want to look at them and take them, go on ahead.
I don't guarantee and won't be held accountable if your computer explodes when you run them.
I've added a d to differentiate from the normal names of some things.
They all live in the namespace drw in C++.
I tend to only recreate the core of the library and maybe add a couple of bells and whistles if I feel like it.


So uh, yeah.
