# Self-Improvement-Things

In this thing, I'll be recreating some data structures and algorithms for learning purposes. 
If you want to look at them and take them, go on ahead.
I don't guarantee and won't be held accountable if your computer explodes when you run them.
I've added a d to differentiate from the normal names of some things.
They all live in the namespace drw in C++.
I tend to only recreate the core of the library and maybe add a couple of bells and whistles if I feel like it.

NOTE: I've attempted to implement smart pointers in some of the classes.
At the moment, the ADTs work as they are supposed to, but the stuff under the hood may not be correct and most likely is making unnecessary calls. 
I'm new to smart pointers, so take them with a grain of salt. 
I'll look over them later on when I go through most of the things I want to learn.
Hopefully, by that time, I'll understand smart pointers more in depth.

So uh, yeah.
